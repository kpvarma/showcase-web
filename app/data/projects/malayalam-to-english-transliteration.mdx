## Approach: How the Problem is Solved

The transliteration is achieved through a structured and efficient process:

1. **Mapping Creation**: A comprehensive mapping table is created that links each language character to its corresponding output language script representation. This ensures accurate phonetic translation.
2. **Text Parsing**: The input text is processed character by character. Each character is matched against the mapping table.
3. **Dynamic Transliteration**: If a match is found, the corresponding Latin equivalent is appended to the output string. Characters not in the mapping are left unchanged, ensuring that unsupported symbols or punctuations are preserved.
4. **Integration**: The tool is implemented using JavaScript and a demo is built along with this site using ReactJS. The use of modular functions ensures that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

This approach ensures that the tool is lightweight, fast, and capable of handling real-time transliteration efficiently.
