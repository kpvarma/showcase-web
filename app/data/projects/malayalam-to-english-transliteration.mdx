# Transliteration Made Easy

This project showcases a robust **JavaScript-based transliteration tool** that converts **Malayalam text** into **Latin script** with diacritical marks, offering an accurate representation of phonetic elements in the original language.

---

## Key Features

- **Language Mapping**: Supports a wide range of Malayalam characters mapped to their Latin diacritical equivalents.
- **Ease of Use**: A simple interface to input text and see real-time transliteration.
- **Interactive Application**: Easily integrated into React-based applications for dynamic user experiences.
- **Preservation of Nuances**: Handles diacritical marks to maintain the richness of Malayalam pronunciation.

## Approach: How the Problem is Solved

The transliteration is achieved through a structured and efficient process:

1. **Mapping Creation**: A comprehensive mapping table is created that links each Malayalam character to its corresponding Latin script representation with diacritical marks. This ensures accurate phonetic translation.
2. **Text Parsing**: The input text is processed character by character. Each character is matched against the mapping table.
3. **Dynamic Transliteration**: If a match is found, the corresponding Latin equivalent is appended to the output string. Characters not in the mapping are left unchanged, ensuring that unsupported symbols or punctuations are preserved.
4. **Integration**: The project is implemented using JavaScript and is easily extendable to React-based applications. The use of modular functions ensures that the codebase is clean and maintainable.

This approach ensures that the tool is lightweight, fast, and capable of handling real-time transliteration efficiently.
