## Problem Statement

Millions of visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in accessing and understanding visual content online. This lack of accessibility creates barriers to engaging with important information, media, and everyday digital interactions, highlighting the need for innovative solutions to bridge this gap.

## Approach:

To address this issue, this project leverages deep learning techniques to develop a model that generates meaningful captions for images. By combining cutting-edge methods in computer vision and natural language processing, the model analyzes image content, generates descriptive captions, and converts them into speech, enabling visually impaired users to “hear” and understand visual content effortlessly.

### **Key Steps in the Solution**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Images were preprocessed by resizing them to <LabelHighlight>(299, 299)</LabelHighlight> and normalizing pixel values to the range <LabelHighlight>[-1, 1]</LabelHighlight>.
   - Captions were tokenized and padded to ensure uniform length.

   ```python
   # Image preprocessing function
   def preprocess_image(image_path):
       img = tf.io.read_file(image_path)
       img = tf.image.decode_jpeg(img, channels=3)
       img = tf.image.resize(img, (299, 299))
       img = tf.keras.applications.inception_v3.preprocess_input(img)
       return img
   ```

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Features were extracted using a pre-trained InceptionV3 model.
   - The extracted features have a shape of <LabelHighlight>(8, 8, 2048)</LabelHighlight>.

   ```python
   # Load pre-trained InceptionV3 for feature extraction
   image_model = tf.keras.applications.InceptionV3(include_top=False, weights="imagenet")
   feature_extraction_model = tf.keras.Model(inputs=image_model.input, outputs=image_model.output)

   # Example feature extraction
   features = feature_extraction_model(preprocess_image(image_path))
   features = tf.reshape(features, (-1, 8*8, 2048))
   ```

3. **Caption Generation**:
   - Captions were generated using an RNN decoder with an attention mechanism.
   - The attention layer helps the model focus on the most relevant parts of the image.

   ```python
   # Decoder class with attention mechanism
   class Decoder(tf.keras.Model):
       def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim, units):
           super(Decoder, self).__init__()
           self.attention = Attention(units)
           self.embedding = tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim)
           self.gru = tf.keras.layers.GRU(units, return_sequences=True, return_state=True)
           self.fc = tf.keras.layers.Dense(vocab_size)

       def call(self, x, features, hidden):
           context_vector, _ = self.attention(features, hidden)
           x = self.embedding(x)
           x = tf.concat([tf.expand_dims(context_vector, 1), x], axis=-1)
           output, state = self.gru(x)
           output = self.fc(output)
           return output, state
   ```

4. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**:
   - Generated captions were converted to speech using Python's <LabelHighlight>gTTS</LabelHighlight> library.
   
   ```python
   from gtts import gTTS

   caption = "A dog is playing in the park."
   tts = gTTS(text=caption, lang="en")
   tts.save("output.mp3")
   ```

## Results

The model achieved promising results in generating meaningful captions for images. Below is an example:

- **Input Image**: An image of a dog playing in a park.
- **Generated Caption**: "A dog is playing in the park."
- **Audio Output**: [Download Sample Audio](output.mp3)

## Future Improvements

- **Scaling the Dataset**: Incorporate larger datasets like MS COCO for better generalization.
- **Real-Time Deployment**: Optimize the model for real-time use on mobile devices.
- **Multilingual Support**: Extend captioning and speech output to multiple languages.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of AI to bridge accessibility gaps for visually impaired users. By combining CNNs, RNNs, and TTS, it provides a comprehensive solution for understanding and describing images in an auditory format.
