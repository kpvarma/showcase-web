# How to Update Emails in Git Commit History: A Step-by-Step Guide

If you’ve changed your email address and want to reflect this in your old Git commits, it’s entirely possible. This guide will walk you through two methods to update email addresses in Git commit history: one using the modern `git-filter-repo` and the other using the older `git filter-branch`. Let's get started.

---

## Why Update Email Addresses in Commit History?

1. **Profile Association:** GitHub associates commits with your profile based on the email in the commit metadata.
2. **Privacy Concerns:** You may have used an email you no longer wish to display publicly.
3. **Consistency:** You want all commits to reflect your current email.

---

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have:
1. A backup of your repository to avoid data loss.
2. A Git installation on your machine.
3. Installed `git-filter-repo` if you plan to use the modern method.

## Method 1: Using `git-filter-repo`

The `git-filter-repo` tool is the recommended way to rewrite Git commit history. It is faster, more reliable, and safer than older tools like `git filter-branch`.

### Steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository as a Mirror
```bash
git clone --mirror <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>.git
```

### Step 2: Install `git-filter-repo`
Install `git-filter-repo` using Python's package manager:
```bash
pip install git-filter-repo
```

### Step 3: Rewrite Commit History
Run the following command to replace old email addresses with the new one:
```bash
git filter-repo --commit-callback '
if commit.author_email == b"old-email@example.com":
    commit.author_email = b"new-email@example.com"
    commit.committer_email = b"new-email@example.com"
if commit.author_email == b"another-old-email@example.com":
    commit.author_email = b"new-email@example.com"
    commit.committer_email = b"new-email@example.com"
'
```

### Step 4: Push Changes
Force-push the rewritten history to the remote repository:
```bash
git push --force --mirror
```

---

## Method 2: Using `git filter-branch`

The `git filter-branch` command is an older tool for rewriting commit history. It’s still functional but less reliable and slower than `git-filter-repo`. Use it only if `git-filter-repo` isn’t an option.

### Steps:

### Step 1: Backup Your Repository
```bash
git clone --mirror <repository-url> backup-repo
```

### Step 2: Rewrite Commit History
Run the following command to replace email addresses:
```bash
git filter-branch --env-filter '
if [ "$GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL" = "old-email@example.com" ]; then
    GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="new-email@example.com";
    GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="new-email@example.com";
fi
' -- --all
```

### Step 3: Push Changes
Force-push the updated history to the remote repository:
```bash
git push --force --all
```

## Comparison: `git-filter-repo` vs `git filter-branch`

| Feature               | `git-filter-repo`                  | `git filter-branch`                |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Speed                | Faster                              | Slower                              |
| Reliability          | High                                | Risk of mangled history             |
| Ease of Use          | Requires installation              | Built-in                            |
| Recommendation       | Preferred for modern workflows      | Legacy, use only if necessary       |

## Important Considerations

- **Impact on Collaborators:** Changing commit history will invalidate old commit hashes. Inform collaborators and advise them to reset their local repositories.
- **Testing:** Always test rewritten history on a local clone before pushing to production.

---

## Conclusion

Both `git-filter-repo` and `git filter-branch` allow you to update email addresses in Git commit history. For most use cases, `git-filter-repo` is the better choice due to its speed and reliability. Remember to back up your repository and test thoroughly before pushing changes.
