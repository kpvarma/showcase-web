# Simplify Rails Development with Docker: Introducing Utility Docker Images for Rails

Managing Ruby on Rails applications across different environments can be challenging. Dependency conflicts, local environment mismatches, and manual setups often hinder productivity. To address this, I created a Docker-based solution specifically for Rails development. This image helps Rails developers scaffold new applications, run development servers, and manage dependencies efficiently—all within isolated containers.
Explore how this tool works and get started with Rails development using my [GitHub repository for utility-docker-images](https://github.com/kpvarma/utility-docker-images).

## A Note on the Rails Base Docker Image

The Rails Docker image is built on top of the official `ruby:3.2.2` image. It includes all the essential tools and configurations needed for Rails 8 development, along with a pre-installed Rails version (`8.0.1`) to ensure compatibility.

With this image, you can:

✅ Scaffold new Rails applications quickly.  
✅ Run development servers in an isolated environment.  
✅ Manage dependencies without polluting your local setup.  
✅ Say goodbye to version conflicts and manual environment setups.

## Features

- **Base Image**: Built on `ruby:3.2.2` for compatibility and stability.
- **Pre-installed Rails 8**: Ready to start modern Rails projects.
- **Development Tools**: Includes `bundler` and essential packages like `build-essential`, `nodejs`, and `yarn`.
- **Streamlined Workflows**: Pre-configured for common Rails tasks.

Explore more about the [Rails Base Image](https://github.com/kpvarma/utility-docker-images/tree/master/base/ruby) and the [Specialized Rails Docker Image](https://github.com/kpvarma/utility-docker-images/tree/master/specialized/ruby/rails) on GitHub.

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the `utility-docker-images` repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kpvarma/utility-docker-images.git
cd utility-docker-images
```

This repository includes Docker configurations for various environments, including the Rails-specific images.

---

## Step 2: Create new rails app

#### **Scaffold a New Application**

You can quickly scaffold a new Rails application using this image, avoiding the need to install Rails locally. Here's how:

1. Create a directory to hold your projects:
   ```bash
   mkdir projects/
   cd projects/
   ```

2. Set the current directory as the project directory:
   ```bash
   export PROJECT_DIR=$PWD
   ```

3. Use the Docker image to scaffold a new Rails application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose run ruby-rails new my_rails_app
   ```
   This creates a new Rails application in the `my_rails_app` directory. All files are generated in the host system directory, ensuring easy access and editing.

---

## Step 3: Run the Rails Development Server

#### **Navigate to Your App Directory**
Move into the directory where your Rails application was created:
```bash
cd my_rails_app
```

#### **Set the Application Directory**
Set the `APP_DIR` environment variable to your application's root:
```bash
export APP_DIR=$PWD
```

#### **Start the Rails Server**
Run the development server using the Rails image:
```bash
docker-compose run --service-ports ruby-rails server
```
The `--service-ports` flag ensures that the container's ports are mapped to your host machine, making the application accessible.

Once started, your Rails app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

---

## Step 4: Set Up Dockerfile and Docker Compose for the Rails App

#### **Prepare Your App for Docker**
Run the provided script to set up a dedicated Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` for your new Rails application. This ensures that the app can run independently with its own configurations:
1. Ensure you are in the `utility-docker-images` root directory.
2. Grant execution permissions to the setup script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x utils/setup-docker-for-rails.sh
   ```

3. Run the script to copy the Dockerfile and `docker-compose.yml` into your app directory:
   ```bash
   ./utils/setup-docker-for-rails.sh
   ```

This step prepares your Rails app to run with a new Docker setup.

---

### **4. Run the New Rails App**

#### **Review Configuration**
Before building and running the Rails app, review the `docker-compose.yml` file in the app directory. Configure database credentials to match your preferred database service (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).

#### **Build and Start the App**
1. Build the Docker image for your Rails app:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Start the application in detached mode:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

#### **Access the App**
The Rails application will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Step 5: Rspec and Exploring Databases (Optional)

If you'd like to enhance your Rails development workflow with this Docker setup, consider adding the following:

### 1. Testing with RSpec or MiniTest
You can easily run tests for your Rails application using this Docker setup. Here’s how:

#### Running RSpec Tests
1. Add RSpec to your Rails application:
   ```bash
   docker-compose run ruby-rails bundle add rspec-rails --group="development, test"
   docker-compose run ruby-rails rails generate rspec:install
   ```

2. Run your test suite:
   ```bash
   docker-compose run ruby-rails bundle exec rspec
   ```

#### Running MiniTest (Default for Rails)
If you are using MiniTest (the default testing framework for Rails), run your tests as follows:
```bash
docker-compose run ruby-rails bundle exec rake test
```

---

### 2. Connecting to a Database
This Docker setup can be easily configured to work with MySQL or PostgreSQL. Here’s how:

#### MySQL Configuration
Ensure your `docker-compose.yml` file has a MySQL service configured like this:
```yaml
services:
  mysql:
    image: mysql:8.0
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: rails_db
      MYSQL_USER: rails_user
      MYSQL_PASSWORD: password
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
```

Update your `config/database.yml` file to match this setup:
```yaml
default: &default
  adapter: mysql2
  encoding: utf8
  pool: 5
  username: rails_user
  password: password
  host: mysql

development:
  <<: *default
  database: rails_db

test:
  <<: *default
  database: rails_db_test
```

#### PostgreSQL Configuration
Similarly, configure a PostgreSQL service in `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: rails_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: rails_db
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
```

And update your `config/database.yml` file for PostgreSQL:
```yaml
default: &default
  adapter: postgresql
  encoding: unicode
  pool: 5
  username: rails_user
  password: password
  host: postgres

development:
  <<: *default
  database: rails_db

test:
  <<: *default
  database: rails_db_test
```

With these additions, you can seamlessly test your Rails applications and connect them to your preferred database service, making your development workflow even more efficient.
