# Welcome to the Interactive MDX Example

This MDX file demonstrates how you can combine **Markdown** with **React components** to create rich, interactive documents.

---

## Embedded React Component

Here is a simple React counter component:

{/* # <Counter /> */}

---

## JS Code Block Example

```javascript
function exampleFunction() {
  console.log("This is a code block example!");
}
```

## Ruby Code Block Example

```ruby
class Example
  def print(val)
    puts val
  end
end
```

## Form Example

MDX supports forms as well. Below is a small form that takes your input and displays it:

{/* <FormExample /> */}

---

## Chart Integration

You can include interactive charts directly within your MDX files. Here's an example using a hypothetical `BarChart` component:

{/* <BarChart
  data={[
    { name: "January", value: 40 },
    { name: "February", value: 30 },
    { name: "March", value: 50 },
  ]}
/> */}

---

## Live Code Demo

Use the `CodeDemo` component to show live code examples:

{/* <CodeDemo code={`<button onClick={() => alert('Hello!')}>Click Me!</button>`} /> */}

---

### How to Use These Components

All of these components are React components that you define in your project. You can pass props to them, manage state, and make them fully interactive.
