## Installing Node.js on Linux

Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime that works seamlessly across platforms. If you're setting it up on Linux, follow this updated guide to get started.

### Step 1: Update Your Package List

Open your terminal and run the following command to ensure your package list is up to date:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

Node.js requires several dependencies to function properly. Install them using:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y curl dirmngr apt-transport-https lsb-release ca-certificates
```

### Step 3: Import the Node.js GPG Key

To verify the authenticity of Node.js packages, import the GPG key:

```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_16.x | sudo -E bash -
```

> **Note:** Replace **16** with the version of Node.js you wish to install.

<blockquote>
**What Is a GPG Key?**
The Node.js GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) key ensures the authenticity of Node.js downloads by verifying that packages are untampered with and come from a trusted source. This key signs the checksum files used to validate the integrity of downloaded files, providing an added layer of security.
</blockquote>

### Step 4: Install Node.js

With the GPG key imported, install Node.js by running:

```code
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```

### Step 5: Verify the Installation

After installation, confirm that Node.js is installed by checking the version:

```code
node -v
```

### Step 6: (Optional) Install Build Tools

If you plan to build native modules for Node.js, install the build tools:

```code
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential
```

### Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully installed Node.js on your Linux system. Whether you're building APIs, web applications, or tools, you're now ready to explore the power of Node.js.
