Transliteration bridges the gap between languages and scripts, making it easier to represent non-Latin scripts like Sanskrit (Devanagari) using diacritical marks. This article explores the mapping of Sanskrit letters to their English equivalents with appropriate marks.

## Introduction

Sanskrit, one of the world's oldest languages and the liturgical language of Hinduism, has a unique and rich script called **Devanagari**. For easier understanding and use in global contexts, it is often transliterated into English using diacritical marks. Below is a detailed mapping of Sanskrit letters and their respective English representations.
